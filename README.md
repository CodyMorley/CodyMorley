Hi, I'm Cody.

You're here because you need something built. But not just anything.

You need something _excellent_ not just someone's idea of a minimum viable product. What you're looking for is something _beautiful_; something that **stands out**.
***Something Different***

And you came looking for me.


That's a pretty good call.

I'm the best of both worlds; a lifelong creative professional with the technical skills to make your dreams come true.
I can work a fully integrated Swift stack from iOS/MacOs/WatchOS to a fully featured vapor application backend. Which not many people on the planet can say.
I've opened for most of my heroes in stand up comedy. I've been a traveling professional entertainer since the age of 17. 
I do not do things small and I do not do things halfway. If you or your company need a sure bet, my inbox is open.
