Hi, I'm Cody.

You're here because you need something built. But not just anything.

You need something _excellent_ not just someone's idea of a minimum viable product. What you're looking for is something _beautiful_; something that **stands out**.
***Something Different***

And you came looking for me.


That's a pretty good call.

I'm the best of both worlds; a lifelong creative professional with the technical skills to make your dreams come true.
I can work a fully integrated Swift stack from iOS/MacOs/WatchOS to a fully featured vapor application backend. Which not many people on the planet can say.
I've opened for Bill Burr, Dave Attell, Jay Mohr, Dane Cook, Ralphie May, and most of my heroes in stand up comedy. I've been a traveling professional entertainer since the age of 17. 
I do not do things small and I do not do things halfway. If you or your company need a sure bet, my inbox is open.
